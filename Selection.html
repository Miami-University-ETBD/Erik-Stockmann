<h2>This page is a work in progress</h2>
<p>This site will eventually be built as an online Clothing Brand Store known as Requiem.</p>
<div>
    Requiem's goal is to create cool clothing designs, with non-toxic materials and dyes. 
</div>
<br>
<div>
    The clothing Industry sadly has an overemphasis on using harsh chemicals and toxic materials in dyes. There are several sites that sell organic clothing, branded with nature or eco-styled designs that don't always look cool or hype. So the founders of Requiem thought why not attempt to create clothing that is kind to your body, <i>and</i> cool and exciting to wear.
