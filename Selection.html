<p>Organic Cotton would likely be the main material. Merino Wool would be really cool to use, but only if the store would get popular enough to be able to afford to get to merino Wool. Nylon could be considered to used in tiny amounts to reinforce Merino wool. Nylon is more iffy however, because it is not nessesarily non-toxic.</p>
