<p>This site will eventually be built as an online Clothing Brand Store known as Requiem.</p>
  <p>This site will also have a page for artwork and ideas. There should also be a spot for feedback.</p>

  <strong>Requiem's goal</strong> is to create cool clothing designs, with non-toxic materials and dyes.

    The Clothing Industry sadly has an overemphasis on using harsh chemicals and toxic materials in dyes. There are several sites that sell organic clothing, however, they are marketed primarily with nature and eco-friendly designs. This isn't nessesarily bad, but more often than not, these designs are not always the most thrilling designs. So the founders of Requiem thought why not attempt to create clothing that is kind to your body, <i>and</i> exciting to wear.
