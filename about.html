  <strong>Anastasis's goal</strong> is to create cool clothing designs, with non-toxic materials and dyes. 
</div>
<p style="margin: 35px auto;padding-left:10px;">Anastasis's founders were on a quest to find clothing that is made with friendly materials, <em>and</em>looks exciting. They found that the clothing Industry sadly has an overemphasis on using harsh chemicals and toxic materials in dyes. Brands were found that sell organic clothing, however, more foten than not, they are marketed to be eco-friendly, rather than to retain a cool factor. The founders of Anastasis had such a hard time finding clothing that fits both categories, they decided to attempt to fill this need themselves. Anastasis's purpose is to create clothing that is kind to your body, <i>and</i> exciting to wear.</p>
